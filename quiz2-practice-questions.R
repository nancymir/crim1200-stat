# Quiz 2


# Normal model

# 1. The patient recovery time from a particular surgical procedure is normally distributed with a mean of 10 days and a standard deviation of 2 days.

# 1.a. What is the z-score for a patient who takes 12 days to recover?

# 1.b. What percentage of patients take 20 days or longer to recover?

# 1.c. What percentage of patients take between 1 and 5 days to recover?

# 1.d. How many days does it take for the 20th percentile of the distribution to recover?




# Linear regression 

# 2. We are going to study the relationship between number of murders per city and number of robberies, only for cities with population > 1,000,000 using the Uniform Crime Reports from 2017, which are crimes reported to the police, and then compiled by the FBI.

# 2.a. What are some ethical concerns you might have with the data?

# 2.b. Load the data.

# 2.c. Draw a scatterplot of actual_robbery_total vs actual_murder. What does the relationship look like?

# 2.d. Fit a simple linear regression where you regress actual_robbery_total onto actual_murder. 

# Before interpreting the coefficients, look at the diagnostic plots. Are the assumptions for fitting the linear model satisfied? 
# A. Homoscedasticity: 
# B. Independence between observations:
# C. Normality of errors: 
# D. Linear relationship between x and y:


# 2.e. What are the outliers? Why do you think they are outliers?

# 2.f. Look at the regression plot on the scatterplot.

# 2.g. Regardless of how the diagnostics look, interpret the slope coefficient. What can you conclude about the relationship between murder and robberies? (Ignore p-values or any measure of uncertainty associated with the coefficient since we haven't covered that in class.)
