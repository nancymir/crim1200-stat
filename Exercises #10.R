# 1. Data

# a. Load the data and preview it
# b. What are the variables in the data? read the codebook
# c. How many individuals' responses were included?


# 2. EDA single variable: Do EDA, visual and quantitative, and write down in words what are some surprising features of each variable.

# a. age2
# b. sexatract
# c. speakengl
# d. irsex

# 3. EDA two variables: Describe the relationship between the two variables visually and quantitatively.

# b. sexatract and speakengl
# c. iralcage and irsex

# 4. EDA two variables for subgroups: How does the relationship between sexatract and spekengl change for women vs men?

# 5. Regressions: Fit linear models for the following relationships.

# a. Are men more likely to use marijuana earlier than women? Is this relationship statistically significant? What does that mean?
# b. Are the age of first use of alcohol and the age of first use of marijuana related? Is this relationship statistically significant?
# c. For both of these, what are the confidence intervals for the relevant parameter? What is the proper way to interpret these?
